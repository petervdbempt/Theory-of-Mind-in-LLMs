colored_trails.py

This module implements the core logic for the Colored Trails game environment.

It handles:
1.  Board generation (random colors, start/goal locations).
2.  Chip distribution and management.
3.  State encoding: Converting sets of chips into unique integer IDs for efficient lookup.
4.  Utility calculation: Determining the value of a position based on held chips and
    distance to the goal using a dynamic programming approach.
