tom_agent.py

This module implements Theory-of-Mind (ToM) agents for the Colored Trails negotiation game.

It contains two primary classes:
1. Tom0_model_ct: A 0th-order model that contains frequency statistics.
2. Agent_ct: A recursive ToM agent (Order k) that models the mental state of other agents
   by simulating their decision-making process using Order k-1 models.
