BOARD (row,col with 0,0 at top-left, [Start]=your position, *Goal*=your goal):

{board_str}

STARTING INFORMATION:
- Goal: ({goal_r}, {goal_c})
- Current position: [Start] (2, 2) 
- Your chips:       {format_chips(my_chips)}
- Opponent chips:   {format_chips(opp_chips)}
- Total chip pool:  {format_chips(total_pool)}

GAME RULES:
- You can only move to adjacent tiles (up/down/left/right, not diagonally).
- You start at [Start] (2, 2). Leaving the starting tile is free (no chip needed).
- Moving onto any other tile costs 1 chip matching that tile's color.
- You DO need a chip to step onto the goal tile.
- Scoring: +100 per step toward goal, +500 for reaching goal, +50 per unused chip.

PROPOSAL RULES:
- You must propose a redistribution of the EXISTING chips (Your Hand + Opponent's Hand). No new chips can be created.
- The numbers you propose are the TOTAL chips you will hold — NOT chips added on top of what you already have.
- The "Total chip pool" is finite. For each color, you cannot request more than (Your Current Chips + Opponent's Current Chips).
- The opponent automatically receives whatever you do not take.
- If the opponent ACCEPTS your proposal, the negotiation ENDS IMMEDIATELY.
- If the opponent REJECTS, it becomes their turn to propose.

NEGOTIATION HISTORY:
{history_str}

YOUR TASK:
{status_line}

Think step by step before deciding, and then output a JSON object with your move:
- "action": {allowed_actions}
- "offer": [w, b, m, g, y] (List of 5 integers. The count of White, Black, Magenta, Gray, Yellow chips YOU will hold.
- "reasoning": "SHORT Strategy explanation"
